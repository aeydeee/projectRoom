          <h1>The Inner and Outer Planets in Our Solar System</h1>
          <p>
            In our Solar System, astronomers often divide the planets into two
            groups — the inner planets and the outer planets. The inner planets
            are closer to the Sun and are smaller and rockier. The outer planets
            are further away, larger and made up mostly of gas.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inner planets (in order of distance from the sun, closest to
            furthest) are Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. After an asteroid belt
            comes the outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The
            interesting thing is, in some other planetary systems discovered,
            the gas giants are actually quite close to the sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            This makes predicting how our Solar System formed an interesting
            exercise for astronomers. Conventional wisdom is that the young Sun
            blew the gases into the outer fringes of the Solar System and that
            is why there are such large gas giants there. However, some
            extrasolar systems have “hot Jupiters” that orbit close to their
            Sun.

      <div class="inner">
        <p>
          The four inner planets are called terrestrial planets because their
          surfaces are solid (and, as the name implies, somewhat similar to
          Earth — although the term can be misleading because each of the four
          has vastly different environments). They’re made up mostly of heavy
          metals such as iron and nickel, and have either no moons or few moons.
          Below are brief descriptions of each of these planets based on this
          information from NASA.

          <h3>Mercury</h3>
          <p>
            Mercury (0.307–0.588 AU or 45.9–88.0 million km; 28.5–54.7 million
            mi from the Sun) is the closest planet to the Sun. The smallest
            planet in the Solar System (0.055 Earth masses), Mercury has no
            natural satellites. The dominant geological features are impact
            craters or basins with ejecta blankets, remnants of early volcanic
            activity including magma flows, and lobed ridges or rupes that were
            likely formed by early contraction in the planet's history.
            Mercury's extremely tenuous atmosphere consists of solar-wind
            particles trapped by its magnetic field, as well as atoms blasted
            off its surface by the solar wind. The explanation for its
            relatively large iron core and thin mantle remains incomplete.
            Hypotheses suggest its outer layers were stripped off by a giant
            impact, or it was hindered from fully accreting due to the young
            Sun's energy. There have been searches for "Vulcanoids," asteroids
            between Mercury and the Sun, but none have been discovered.

          <h3>Venus</h3>
          <p>
            Venus was once considered a twin planet to Earth, until astronomers
            discovered its surface is at a lead-melting temperature of 900
            degrees Fahrenheit (480 degrees Celsius). The planet is also a slow
            rotator, with a 243-day long Venusian day and an orbit around the
            sun at 225 days. Its atmosphere is thick and contains carbon dioxide
            and nitrogen. The planet has no rings or moons and is currently
            being visited by the European Space Agency’s Venus Express
            spacecraft.

          <h3>Earth</h3>
          <p>
            Earth (0.983â€"1.017 AU (147.1â€"152.1 million km; 91.4â€"94.5
            million mi) from the Sun) is the largest and densest of the inner
            planets, the only one known to have current geological activity, and
            the only place in the universe where life is known to exist. Its
            liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it
            is the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed. Earth's
            atmosphere is radically different from those of the other planets,
            having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free
            oxygen. The planetary magnetosphere shields the surface from solar
            and cosmic radiation, limiting atmospheric stripping and maintaining
            habitability. It has one natural satellite, the Moon.

          <h3>Mars</h3>
          <p>
            Mars (1.382â€"1.666 AU (206.7â€"249.2 million km; 128.5â€"154.9
            million mi) from the Sun) is smaller than Earth and Venus (0.107
            ME). It has an atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface
            pressure of 6.1 millibars (0.088 psi; 0.18 inHg); roughly 0.6% of
            that of Earth but sufficient to support weather phenomena. Its
            surface, peppered with volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift
            valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that
            may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago. Its red
            color comes from iron oxide (rust) in its soil, while the polar
            regions show white ice caps consisting largely of water. Mars has
            two tiny natural satellites (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be either
            captured asteroids, or ejected debris from a massive impact early in
            Mars's history

        <p>
          The four outer planets, also called giant planets or Jovian planets,
          collectively make up 99% of the mass known to orbit the Sun. Jupiter
          and Saturn are together more than 400 times the mass of Earth and
          consist overwhelmingly of the gases hydrogen and helium, hence their
          designation as gas giants. Uranus and Neptune are far less
          massiveâ€"less than 20 Earth masses (ME) eachâ€"and are composed
          primarily of ice. For these reasons, some astronomers suggest they
          belong in their own category, ice giants. All four giant planets have
          rings, although only Saturn's ring system is easily observed from
          Earth. The term superior planet designates planets outside Earth's
          orbit and thus includes both the outer planets

          <h3>Jupiter</h3>
          <p>
            Jupiter (4.951â€"5.457 AU (740.7â€"816.4 million km; 460.2â€"507.3
            million mi) from the Sun), at 318 ME, is 2.5 times the mass of all
            the other planets put together. It is composed largely of hydrogen
            and helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates semi-permanent
            features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red
            Spot. The planet possesses a 4.2â€"14 Gauss strength magnetosphere
            that spans 22â€"29 million km, making it, in certain respects, the
            largest object in the Solar System. Jupiter has 95 known satellites.
            The four largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, are called the
            Galilean moons: they show similarities to the terrestrial planets,
            such as volcanism and internal heating. Ganymede, the largest
            satellite in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury; Callisto is
            almost as large.

          <h3>Saturn</h3>
          <p>
            Saturn (9.075â€"10.07 AU (1.3576â€"1.5065 billion km; 843.68€"936.1
            million mi) from the Sun[86]), distinguished by its extensive ring
            system, has several similarities to Jupiter, such as its atmospheric
            composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% of Jupiter's
            volume, it is less than a third as massive, at 95 ME, Saturn is the
            only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water. The
            rings of Saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles.[136]
            Saturn has 145 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of
            these, Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological activity; [137]
            they, as well as five other Saturnian moons (Iapetus, Rhea, Dione,
            Tethys, and Mimas), are large enough to be round. Titan, the
            second-largest moon in the Solar System, is bigger than Mercury and
            the only satellite in the Solar System to have a substantial
            atmosphere.

          <h3>Uranus</h3>
          <p>
            Uranus (18.27â€"20.06 AU (2.733â€"3.001 billion km; 1.698â€"1.865
            billion mi) from the Sun), at 14 ME, has the lowest mass of the
            outer planets. Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its
            side; its axial tilt is over ninety degrees to the ecliptic. This
            gives the planet extreme seasonal variation as each pole points
            toward and then away from the Sun. It has a much colder core than
            the other giant planets and radiates very little heat into space.
            [141] As a consequence, it has the coldest planetary atmosphere in
            the Solar System. Uranus has 27 known satellites, the largest ones
            being Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda. Like the other
            giant planets, it possesses a ring system and magnetosphere

          <h3>Neptune</h3>
          <p>
            Neptune (29.89–30.47 AU from the Sun) is slightly smaller than
            Uranus but more massive (17 ME), making it denser. It's the eighth
            planet from the Sun, known as an ice giant due to its composition of
            water, ammonia, and methane. The methane gives Neptune its striking
            blue color. Despite its distance, Neptune has a dynamic atmosphere
            with winds reaching up to 1,300 mph, the fastest in the Solar
            System. Neptune's atmosphere is composed of hydrogen, helium, and
            traces of methane, giving it its distinctive blue color. It also
            experiences extreme seasonal variations due to its axial tilt,
            though less pronounced than Uranus. Neptune has a faint ring system
            and 14 known moons, the largest being Triton.

        <h2>The Formation of the Solar System</h2>
        <img src="images/formation.webp" alt="formation of solar system" />
        <p id="overview">
          <em>
            The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the
            gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud.
            This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and
            probably birthed several stars. As is typical of molecular clouds,
            this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small
            amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars.
            As the pre-solar nebula collapsed, conservation of angular momentum
            caused it to rotate faster. The center, where most of the mass
            collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. As
            the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a
            protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU (30 billion
            km; 19 billion mi) and a hot, dense protostar at the center. The
            planets formed by accretion from this disc, in which dust and gas
            gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger
            bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar
            System, but they either merged or were destroyed or ejected, leaving
            the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.
